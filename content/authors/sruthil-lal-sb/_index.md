I am a Research Scholar at the Department of Physics, Pondicherry University. My present work focusses on probing the origin of optical nonlinearlities of different materials. Simulations based on DFT, TDDFT and Many-body perturbation are combined with experiments to understand the nonlinear optical response of material. My PhD dissertation primarily deals with the nonlinear optical response of anatase phase of TiOâ‚‚, investigated using femtosecond lasers and Real-time TDDFT simulations. I am expected to complete my dissertation by the end of this year (2022).
