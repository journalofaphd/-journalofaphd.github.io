The influence of non-interacting Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian on the non-self
consistent GW (G0 W0 ) quasiparticle gap and Bethe-Salpeter-Equation(BSE) optical
spectra of anatase TiO2 is systematically evaluated. G0 W0 and BSE calculations are
carried out starting with HSE06 (Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof) type functionals containing
20, 25 and 30 % exact Hartree-Fock exchange. The results are also compared against
G0 W0 +BSE calculations starting from semi-local(PBE) functionals. Our results
indicate that the G0 W0 and BSE calculations of anatase TiO2 depend critically on
the mean-field starting point, wherein its dependence is mainly introduced through
the dielectric screening evaluated at the intermediate G0 W0 . We find that the band
dispersion, density of states, and consequently the oscillator strengths of optical
excitation and spatial localization of excitons are insensitive to the starting points
while the quasiparticle gap, optical gap and exciton binding energies are strongly
affected. G0 W0 quasiparticle gap of anatase TiO2 computed over hybrid functional
starting points is typically overestimated compared to measured values. However, by
varying the amount of exact exchange, the dielectric screening can be tuned, and thus
the quasiparticle gap. Exciton binding energy is shown to increase in proportion to
the increase of the amount of exact exchange. A simple extrapolation of the calculated
data leads to the exact match with the recently measured value with 13 % of the exact
exchange. Systematic analysis of G0 W0 +BSE calculation starting from screened hybrid
functionals provided in this study forms a reference for all such future calculations of
pristine anatase TiO2 and its derivatives.
