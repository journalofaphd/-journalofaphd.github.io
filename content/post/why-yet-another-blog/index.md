title: The First Post:- Why yet another Ph. D. blog?
subtitle: In my opinion, everyone who is undergoing a Ph. D. must write their views and experiences somewhere. Researchers are trained to be masters of the most advanced form of documenting scientifc knowledge. Yet, I wonder, why don't we feel the need to document our experiences and acquired wisdom as much? I think it is as important as documenting science.

## Putting Together 
After my profiles on researchgate, LinkedIn, Google scholar, twitter, orcid, academia...I can't wait to tell you that I have finally put together a personal website and blog. It is primarily aimed as a platform to present my work and life as a mediocre Ph. D. researcher, sometimes to tell the world how proud I am about my academic journey, to boast about how I celebrate little wins etc..and other times to rant on about experiement that I could not do, to complain about having too much tea everyday ans so on. On the other hand, the webpage has been put up here for little **self promotion** too. This is essentially going to be a place to put down capsules of wisdom that crystallized in me during my stint a researcher. That makes the title of the site **Journal of a Ph. D.** an appropriate one. Being a first generation individual from my family to have pursued the highest degree, I had my share of challenges along the way. I genuinely feel that I should pass on my wisdom so that successive generations would not strugle as much. After all that's what we always say-**on the shoulders of giants** :innocent:

## Being helpful
**It feels so good to be helpful**. I envisage this would become a place where my shared experiences and knowledge will become useful to younger generation of researchers.  I have asked people, emailed professors/authors corresponding authors directly and often got positive responses. It feels so good when you feel your concerns are heard. On researchgate I often get messages asking for help to specific details of practical DFT calculations. I have taken time and energy to prepare detailed answers to adress their queries. At the end we feel so grateful of heing able to help someone. I will also be putting togethor such techincal details of my expertise here. It is an attempt to organize my thoughts and experiences with the expectation that someone at a different of the world might find it useful someday. 

I feel this is a way of giving back to the society of after enjoying the prileges of long years of education and training. It is also an opportunity to get some writing practice, writing has always been difficult for me.
