title: The First Post:- Why yet another Ph. D. blog?
subtitle: In my opinion, everyone who is undergoing a Ph. D. must write their views and experiences somewhere. Researchers are trained to be masters of the most advanced form of documenting scientifc knowledge. Yet, I wonder, why don't we feel the need to document our experiences and acquired wisdom as much? I think it is as important as documenting science.

## Journal of a mediocre researcher
After my profiles on researchgate, LinkedIn, Google scholar, twitter, orcid, academia...I can't wait to tell you that I have finally put together a personal website and blog. It is primarily aimed as a platform to present my work and life as a mediocre Ph. D. researcher, sometimes to tell the world how proud I am about my academic journey, to boast about how I celebrate little wins etc..and other times to rant on about experiement that I could not do, to complain about having too much tea everyday ans so on. On the other hand, the webpage has been put up here for little **self promotion** too. This is essentially going to be a place to put down capsules of wisdom that crystallized in me during my stint a researcher. That makes the title of the site **Journal of a Ph. D.** an appropriate one. Being a first generation individual from my family to have pursued the highest degree, I had my share of challenges along the way. I genuinely feel that I should pass on my wisdom so that successive generations would not strugle as much. After all that's what we always say-**on the shoulders of giants** :innocent:

## Being helpful
**It feels so good to be helpful**. I envisage this would become a place where my experiences and knowledge will become useful to younger generation of researchers. There were times during my Ph. D days I hit roadblocks and stagnant for several days. When there are no stones unturned I started asking for help to people over the internet. I emailed professors/corresponding authors directly as a last resort. Quite often I got positive responses. It feels so good when you feel your concerns are heard. I too get some questions sometimes, asking for specific details of some specific analysis I have carried out. I have taken time and energy to adress their queries, at least without disappointing them. At the end we feel so grateful of being able to help someone. I think it would also be great to record my technical experience here. It is an attempt to organize my thoughts and experiences with the expectation that someone at a different of the world might find it useful someday. I feel this is a way of giving back to the society after enjoying the privileges of long years of education and training.


## Putting together a website from scratch
Setting up a personal website like this is not at all a difficult task nowadays. This site has been made using Hugo static website generator with no HTML coding. There are many other such framework exisit using which you can make stunning personal websites. The academic theme for Hugo was used for making this site. Once it is set up a few lines of codes will only take to host the site in GitHub.  It is super easy. Why don't you make one for yourself?!
