## Putting Together 
After my profiles on researchgate, LinkedIn, Google scholar, twitter, orcid, academia...I can't wait to announce to you that I have finally put together a personal website and blog. It is primarily aimed as a platform to present my work and life as a mediocre Ph. D. researcher, to rant on about experiement that I could not do, to complain about having too much tea everyday, to boast about how I celebrate little wins, and finally for little **self promotion**. This is essentially going to be a place where I put down capsules of wisdom that crystallized in me during my stint a researcher. Being a first generation individual from my family to have pursued the hughest degree, I had my share of challenges along the way. I genuinely feel that I should pass on my wisdom so that another first generation would not strugle as much. 

Why name Journal of a Ph. D. ?

## Being helpful
**It feels so good to be helpful**. I envisage this would become a place where my shared experiences and knowledge will become useful to younger generation of researchers.  I have asked people, emailed professors/authors corresponding authors directly and often got positive responses. It feels so good when you feel your concerns are heard. On researchgate I often get messages asking for help to specific details of practical DFT calculations. I have taken time and energy to prepare detailed answers to adress their queries. At the end we feel so grateful of heing able to help someone. I will also be putting togethor such techincal details of my expertise here. It is an attempt to organize my thoughts and experiences with the expectation that someone at a different of the world might find it useful someday. 

I feel this is a way of giving back to the society of after enjoying the prileges of long years of education and training. It is also an opportunity to get some writing practice, writing has always been difficult for me.
