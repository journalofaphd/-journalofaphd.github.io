abstract:  Infections associated with medical devices that are caused by biofilms remain a considerable challenge for health care systems owing to their multidrug resistance patterns. Biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus can result in life-threatening situations which are tough to eliminate by traditional methods. Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDT) constitutes an alternative method of killing deadly pathogens and their biofilms using reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study investigated the efficacy of enhanced in vitro aPDT of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus using malachite green conjugated to carboxyl-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MGCNT). Both the planktonic cells and biofilms of test bacteria were demonstrated to be susceptible to the MGCNT conjugate. These MGCNT conjugates may thus be employed as a facile strategy for designing antibacterial and anti-biofilm coatings to prevent the infections associated with medical devices. 


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The influence of non-interacting Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian on the non-self consistent GW(G 0 W 0) quasiparticle gap and Bethe–Salpeter-equation (BSE) optical spectra of anatase TiO2 is systematically evaluated. G 0 W 0 and BSE calculations are carried out starting with HSE06 (Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof) type functionals containing 20%, 25% and 30% exact Hartree–Fock exchange.
