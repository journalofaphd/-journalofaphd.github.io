&lt;p>The paper went through countless revisions and many rejections before finding a venue for publication. As this work came to fruition, it brought significant personal and professional transformationâ€”shoutouts to all who have been a part of this challenging but satisfying journey to fruition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the most part, I was battling self-doubt and writerâ€™s block. Each time, I forced myself to read the draft one last time. By the hundredth time, I had learned my paper word by word by heart so that even embarrassing mistakes missed my eyes. Having seen no improvement, I lost interest many times and procrastinated. I re-challenged myself.&lt;/p>

Putting the work in the context of the literature had its challenges. All papers felt so relevant that my web browser started screaming at me with about 200+ opened tabs. I had to make tough decisions to let everything go and start from scratch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried many strategies to navigate each roadblock, negotiating turns and twists. I enjoyed learning how fellow researchers worldwide have found their way through. It has taken me a long way to optimize life and work, ultimately finding balance.
If I had to pick a few things that transformed me personally and professionally, this paper would be my first pick. I have become efficient at many things, including avoiding getting overwhelmed beyond control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To cherish the achievement, as a reminder of energy and effort invested, as a testament of perseverance and more importantly, to have a sense of achievement, I am rewarding myself with this gift.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know this experience is not something unique to me. Any budding researcher would have gone through this or currently going through it. It is a feeling many in academia can relate to. &lt;strong>It is also to remind my fellow researchers not to forget to celebrate small victories like this and to reward yourselves with such sweet little treats. Train yourselves to learn to enjoy the process, not just the results.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The First Post:- Why yet another Ph. D. blog?</title><link>https://journalofaphd.github.io/post/why-yet-another-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://journalofaphd.github.io/post/why-yet-another-blog/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="putting-together">Putting Together&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After my profiles on researchgate, LinkedIn, Google scholar, twitter, orcid, academia&amp;hellip;I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to tell you that I have finally put together a personal website and blog. It is primarily aimed as a platform to present my work and life as a mediocre Ph. D. researcher, sometimes to tell the world how proud I am about my academic journey, to boast about how I celebrate little wins etc..and other times to rant on about experiement that I could not do, to complain about having too much tea everyday ans so on. On the other hand, the webpage has been put up here for little &lt;strong>self promotion&lt;/strong> too. This is essentially going to be a place to put down capsules of wisdom that crystallized in me during my stint a researcher. That makes the title of the site &lt;strong>Journal of a Ph. D.&lt;/strong> an appropriate one. Being a first generation individual from my family to have pursued the highest degree, I had my share of challenges along the way. I genuinely feel that I should pass on my wisdom so that successive generations would not strugle as much. After all that&amp;rsquo;s what we always say-&lt;strong>on the shoulders of giants&lt;/strong> ðŸ˜‡&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="being-helpful">Being helpful&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It feels so good to be helpful&lt;/strong>. I envisage this would become a place where my shared experiences and knowledge will become useful to younger generation of researchers. I have asked people, emailed professors/authors corresponding authors directly and often got positive responses. It feels so good when you feel your concerns are heard. On researchgate I often get messages asking for help to specific details of practical DFT calculations. I have taken time and energy to prepare detailed answers to adress their queries. At the end we feel so grateful of heing able to help someone. I will also be putting togethor such techincal details of my expertise here. It is an attempt to organize my thoughts and experiences with the expectation that someone at a different of the world might find it useful someday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel this is a way of giving back to the society of after enjoying the prileges of long years of education and training. It is also an opportunity to get some writing practice, writing has always been difficult for me.&lt;/p>
