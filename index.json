Optical properties, especially nonlinear optical properties, of Titanium dioxide changes significantly while it is doped with metals like Silver, Gold and Manganese. Rather than exhibiting a monotonous enhancement or diminution of nonlinear optical properties with respect to an increase in the concentration of the dopant it attains maximum at certain optimal concentrations. First principle simulation of optical properties of Titanium Dioxide, both pristine as well as doped with impurities at different concentrations will help us to predict the composition of the material with superior tailor-made properties before it is tested by experiments.\nWe carry out Ab-initio simulation of nonlinear optical properties of Titanium Dioxide based on Density Functional Theory(DFT). It is proposed to use different Hierarchy of approximations namely in DFT, Generalized Gradient Approximation(GGA), Hybrid DFT(HSE), to optimize the calculation parameters so that the results can be bench marked with experiments. In addition, in order to overcome the limitations of ground state DFT to calculate properties involving excited states (optical excitation spectra for instance) it requires the use of other computationally intensive advanced techniques that use Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) or GW method. The proposed scheme of complete simulation involves\n Structural optimization(Volume Relaxation) of the system by energy minimization to optimize the structural parameters Self-Consistent Field Calculation of relaxed structure Calculation of Band structure and optical properties using HSE (Hybrid) Functional to account for the band gap problem inherent in standard GGA-DFT methods Quasi-particle Correction to band structure and optical properties of bulk anatase titanium dioxide by performing Hybrid DFT and Green’s function based GW calculations Repetition of the above for titanium dioxide system in which metal dopants are incorporated.  We plan to use 5 metal atoms as dopant each of which will be incorporated in the system in five different concentrations making it a set of 25 different computational systems. The average time required per computational system for carrying out the work as mentioned in the proposal is given below showing the detailed break-up over individual jobs. These have been estimated based on the benchmark calculation performed using Vienna Ab-initio simulation Package(VASP) for a super cell containing 50 to 60 atoms.\n","date":1651096800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651096800,"objectID":"e752844e8eee8a573760b9b2686918bf","permalink":"https://journalofaphd.github.io/project/dft/","publishdate":"2022-04-27T22:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dft/","section":"project","summary":"Optimization of structure of anatase TiO2 in the Ground state and its electronic and optical properties.","tags":["DFT","VASP"],"title":"DFT simulation of anatase TiO₂","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sruthil"],"categories":["Demo","HowTo","VASP"],"content":"Celebrating Small Wins Test TEst The paper went through countless revisions and many rejections before finding a venue for publication. As this work came to fruition, it brought significant personal and professional transformation—shoutouts to all who have been a part of this challenging but satisfying journey to fruition.\nFor the most part, I was battling self-doubt and writer’s block. Each time, I forced myself to read the draft one last time. By the hundredth time, I had learned my paper word by word by heart so that even embarrassing mistakes missed my eyes. Having seen no improvement, I lost interest many times and procrastinated. I re-challenged myself.\nPutting the work in the context of the literature had its challenges. All papers felt so relevant that my web browser started screaming at me with about 200+ opened tabs. I had to make tough decisions to let everything go and start from scratch.\nI tried many strategies to navigate each roadblock, negotiating turns and twists. I enjoyed learning how fellow researchers worldwide have found their way through. It has taken me a long way to optimize life and work, ultimately finding balance. If I had to pick a few things that transformed me personally and professionally, this paper would be my first pick. I have become efficient at many things, including avoiding getting overwhelmed beyond control.\nTo cherish the achievement, as a reminder of energy and effort invested, as a testament of perseverance and more importantly, to have a sense of achievement, I am rewarding myself with this gift.\nI know this experience is not something unique to me. Any budding researcher would have gone through this or currently going through it. It is a feeling many in academia can relate to. It is also to remind my fellow researchers not to forget to celebrate small victories like this and to reward yourselves with such sweet little treats.

G0 W0 and BSE calculations are carried out starting with HSE06 (Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof) type functionals containing 20, 25 and 30 % exact Hartree-Fock exchange. The results are also compared against G0 W0 +BSE calculations starting from semi-local(PBE) functionals. Our results indicate that the G0 W0 and BSE calculations of anatase TiO2 depend critically on the mean-field starting point, wherein its dependence is mainly introduced through the dielectric screening evaluated at the intermediate G0 W0 . We find that the band dispersion, density of states, and consequently the oscillator strengths of optical excitation and spatial localization of excitons are insensitive to the starting points while the quasiparticle gap, optical gap and exciton binding energies are strongly affected. G0 W0 quasiparticle gap of anatase TiO2 computed over hybrid functional starting points is typically overestimated compared to measured values. However, by varying the amount of exact exchange, the dielectric screening can be tuned, and thus the quasiparticle gap. Exciton binding energy is shown to increase in proportion to the increase of the amount of exact exchange. A simple extrapolation of the calculated data leads to the exact match with the recently measured value with 13 % of the exact exchange. Systematic analysis of G0 W0 +BSE calculation starting from screened hybrid functionals provided in this study forms a reference for all such future calculations of pristine anatase TiO2 and its derivatives.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"74d04ca8e9b304a4ff4bcfc2ee8e1578","permalink":"https://journalofaphd.github.io/project/mbpt/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mbpt/","section":"project","summary":"An example of using the in-built project page.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Many-Body Perturbation Theory Calculations of Anatase TiO₂","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
