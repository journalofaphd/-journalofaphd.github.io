The results are also compared against G0 W0 +BSE calculations starting from semi-local(PBE) functionals. Our results indicate that the G0 W0 and BSE calculations of anatase TiO2 depend critically on the mean-field starting point, wherein its dependence is mainly introduced through the dielectric screening evaluated at the intermediate G0 W0 . We find that the band dispersion, density of states, and consequently the oscillator strengths of optical excitation and spatial localization of excitons are insensitive to the starting points while the quasiparticle gap, optical gap and exciton binding energies are strongly affected. G0 W0 quasiparticle gap of anatase TiO2 computed over hybrid functional starting points is typically overestimated compared to measured values. However, by varying the amount of exact exchange, the dielectric screening can be tuned, and thus the quasiparticle gap. Exciton binding energy is shown to increase in proportion to the increase of the amount of exact exchange. A simple extrapolation of the calculated data leads to the exact match with the recently measured value with 13 % of the exact exchange. Systematic analysis of G0 W0 +BSE calculation starting from screened hybrid functionals provided in this study forms a reference for all such future calculations of pristine anatase TiO2 and its derivatives.\n","date":1669248e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669248e3,"objectID":"74d04ca8e9b304a4ff4bcfc2ee8e1578","permalink":"https://journalofaphd.github.io/project/mbpt/","publishdate":"2022-11-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mbpt/","section":"project","summary":"Calculation of electronic structure and optical properties of anatase TiO₂ using Green's function based methods.","tags":["Electronic Structure"],"title":"Many-Body Perturbation Theory Calculations of Anatase TiO₂","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is an emerging strategy to treat antibiotic resistant micro- organisms. This technique is selective, painless, less invasive, and can be focused on multiple targets, thereby ensuring photodestruction of target cells without producing photoresistant cells. The antimicrobial effect of this strategy relies on an oxidative burst that occurs when photoreactive molecules are exposed to certain wavelengths of light. A nontoxic dye or photoreactive molecule called a photosensitizer, light of suitable wavelength, and molecular oxygen are the three major compo nents involved in the photodynamic inactivation of microbial cells. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a key role in aPDT. The excited photosensitizer, after illumination with a light of suitable wavelength, enters into an unstable triplet state resulting in ROS generation, which occurs through two different photoprocesses. In a type I photoreaction, electron transfer from the triplet state photosensitizer to the surrounding oxygen occurs and results in the formation of super-oxide, peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals. In a type II photoreaction, energy is transferred directly from the triplet state photosensitizer to molecular oxygen, thereby forming singlet oxygen which is highly reactive. ROS can act on a diverse range of cellular targets, causing death of a broad range of pathogens by damaging almost all biomolecules including lipids, protein, and nucleic acids\n","date":1669248e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669248e3,"objectID":"919503f876006c38f167c8829b946945","permalink":"https://journalofaphd.github.io/project/pdt/","publishdate":"2022-11-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pdt/","section":"project","summary":"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is an emerging strategy to treat antibiotic resistant microorganisms.","tags":["Microbiology"],"title":"Photodynamic Therapy","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We use the double Stokes–Mueller polarimetry (DSMP) technique, to characterize a large size (3x3x5 mm) Potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) crystal.

The oscillating dipoles emit a polarization wave which can modify temporal and spatial properties of the incident field. For sufficiently strong perturbing fields the polarization response of the medium becomes nonlinear. The nonlinear contribution to the polarization gives rise to a variety of nonlinear optical phenomena. This chapter discusses theoretical description of nonlinear optical pulse propagation in materials and experimental probes to investigate them.\nLaser-matter interaction dynamics involves the the excitation of the particle-hole pair. The particle and hole carriers affects the electromagnetic response of the material, screening the field depending on its density. These aspects of electron dynamics are included within the framework of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). TDDFT is fully quantum mechanical and does not require any assumptions about the dynamics. The electronic motion within TDDFT is described by the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation (TDKS) for the evolution of single particle orbitals (Kohn-Sham orbitals). TDKS can be viewed as an alternative formulation of time-dependent quantum mechanics but, in contrast to the normal approach that relies on wave-functions and on the many-body Schrödinger equation, its basic variable is the one-body electron density. From the density obtained by TDKS, we obtain the time-dependent polarizability p(t) of a system with a given external time-dependent potential. p(t) essentially contain all information of the system interacting with the external field. We apply TDDFT to describe the nonlinear weak-field and non-perturbatvie electron dynamics of TiO2 induced by intense ultrashort laser pulses.\n","date":1669248e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669248e3,"objectID":"de8d9e2108cd457811727fad1d358de8","permalink":"https://journalofaphd.github.io/project/tddft/","publishdate":"2022-11-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tddft/","section":"project","summary":"Simulating laser-driven electron dynamics in solids using TDDFT","tags":["Electronic Structure","TDDFT"],"title":"Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sruthil Lal SB","Murali D","Matthias Posselt","Assa Aravindh Sasikala Devi","Alok Sharan A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1669068e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669068e3,"objectID":"dcf34df6143ac02541f09efee52be6f5","permalink":"https://journalofaphd.github.io/publication/aip-ssps/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aip-ssps/","section":"publication","summary":"The electronic structure and quasi-particle absorption spectra of anatase titanium dioxide has been calculated by employing state of the art density functional theory(DFT) and Many-Body Perturbation Theory methods(MBPT) within the framework of Hybrid Density Functional(HSE).","tags":["TiO₂","DFT","VASP"],"title":"Accurate determination of quasi-particle electronic and optical spectra of anatase titanium dioxide","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sruthil Lal SB","Murali D","Matthias Posselt","Assa Aravindh Sasikala Devi","Alok Sharan A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1669068e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669068e3,"objectID":"1f38ee7584bb8fc48ae4d2a677ea6b4f","permalink":"https://journalofaphd.github.io/publication/electronic-structure/","publishdate":"2022-11-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/electronic-structure/","section":"publication","summary":"The influence of non-interacting Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian on the non-self consistent GW(G 0 W 0) quasiparticle gap and Bethe–Salpeter-equation (BSE) optical spectra of anatase TiO2 is systematically evaluated.

Optical properties, especially nonlinear optical properties, of Titanium dioxide changes significantly while it is doped with metals like Silver, Gold and Manganese. Rather than exhibiting a monotonous enhancement or diminution of nonlinear optical properties with respect to an increase in the concentration of the dopant it attains maximum at certain optimal concentrations. First principle simulation of optical properties of Titanium Dioxide, both pristine as well as doped with impurities at different concentrations will help us to predict the composition of the material with superior tailor-made properties before it is tested by experiments.\nWe carry out Ab-initio simulation of nonlinear optical properties of Titanium Dioxide based on Density Functional Theory(DFT). It is proposed to use different Hierarchy of approximations namely in DFT, Generalized Gradient Approximation(GGA), Hybrid DFT(HSE), to optimize the calculation parameters so that the results can be bench marked with experiments. In addition, in order to overcome the limitations of ground state DFT to calculate properties involving excited states (optical excitation spectra for instance) it requires the use of other computationally intensive advanced techniques that use Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) or GW method. The proposed scheme of complete simulation involves\n Structural optimization(Volume Relaxation) of the system by energy minimization to optimize the structural parameters Self-Consistent Field Calculation of relaxed structure Calculation of Band structure and optical properties using HSE (Hybrid) Functional to account for the band gap problem inherent in standard GGA-DFT methods Quasi-particle Correction to band structure and optical properties of bulk anatase titanium dioxide by performing Hybrid DFT and Green’s function based GW calculations Repetition of the above for titanium dioxide system in which metal dopants are incorporated.  We plan to use 5 metal atoms as dopant each of which will be incorporated in the system in five different concentrations making it a set of 25 different computational systems. The average time required per computational system for carrying out the work as mentioned in the proposal is given below showing the detailed break-up over individual jobs. These have been estimated based on the benchmark calculation performed using Vienna Ab-initio simulation Package(VASP) for a super cell containing 50 to 60 atoms.\n","date":1666648800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666648800,"objectID":"e752844e8eee8a573760b9b2686918bf","permalink":"https://journalofaphd.github.io/project/dft/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T22:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dft/","section":"project","summary":"Optimization of structure of anatase TiO2 in the Ground state and its electronic and optical properties.","tags":["Electronic Structure"],"title":"DFT simulation of anatase TiO₂","type":"project"},{"authors":["Anju V T","Parasuraman Paramanantham","Sruthil Lal SB","Alok Sharan","Asad Syed","Needa A Bahkali","Marzouq H Alsaedi","Kaviyarasu K","Siddhardha Busi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569621600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569621600,"objectID":"4ad2dee2927c22bfb427c430623cf844","permalink":"https://journalofaphd.github.io/publication/pdt-3/","publishdate":"2022-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pdt-3/","section":"publication","summary":"The emergence of drug-resistant bacterial strains has raised the need to develop alternative treatment modalities to combat infectious diseases.
